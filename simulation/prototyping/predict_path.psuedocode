## Pseudocode: PathPrediction


**Main:**

Initialize each target's previous position to None

Initialize each target's speed to 0

Get current positions for each target

Initialize centroid's previous position to None

Calculate current centroid position

Set Predict equal to True

While Predict is True

	Update the target's positions

	If unable to update the target's positions

		Set Predict equal to False

		Break out of loop

	Estimate target speed using (distance) / (time)

	Update the centroid position using the current target positions

	Call 'predictPath': Predict each target's sequence of predicted future positions

	Call 'calcCentroidPath': Use the Paths to predict the positions of the centroid

Output the target and centroid paths



**predictPath:**

Initialize Paths to store each target's predicted path points

For each target:


	Set p as target's current position

	Set the first element of the path to p (starting location)

	Set w is current waypoint

	Set s as the current position (source point)

	While there are still waypoints:

		Set Theta as the angle between w and the x-axis		

		Set ThetaPrime as the angle between p and the x-axis

		Calculate the (x, y) velocity components using 
		( X-velocity = cosine (ThetaPrime) * target speed,
		Y-velocity = sine (ThetaPrime) * target speed )

		Set interval vector i with distance that would be traveled in the time interval using
		(X-velocity * timeInterval, Y-velocity * timeInterval)

		Calculate the magnitude of i using hypotenuse of the components

		Rotate the interval vector toward the waypoint by calculating the
		components of a vector whose magnitude is equal to i's and whose
		angle is equal to w's 

		Set p as the vector addition of p and i (extend p in direction of w)

		Add p to target's Path

		Calculate the distance from source point to waypoint w

		Calculate the distance from source point to current predicted point p 

		If p is further away than the waypoint:

			Set w as the next waypoint, since w has been reached

			Set s as previous waypoint, which is now the source point
		
return Paths
